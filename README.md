**Coupon Acceptance Analysis**
**Overview**

This project explores a survey dataset describing different driving scenarios and examines factors that influence whether a driver will accept a coupon. The analysis focuses on understanding acceptance behavior across coupon types and identifying patterns that could support more effective targeting strategies.

**Dataset**

The dataset includes information on:

Coupon type (e.g., Bar, Coffee House)

Contextual driving features (time, destination, passenger)

Behavioral indicators (venue visit frequency)

Target variable (Y) indicating coupon acceptance

**Data file:**
data/coupons.csv

**Approach**

Established a baseline coupon acceptance rate

Compared acceptance rates across coupon types

Conducted focused analysis on Bar and Coffee House coupons

Used visualizations to highlight differences in acceptance behavior

The emphasis is on interpretability and exploratory insights.
**Key Findings**

Bar coupons are more likely to be accepted by individuals who already visit bars frequently.

Acceptance is higher in adult social contexts (e.g., no child passengers).

Coffee House coupon acceptance increases with higher visit frequency and varies by time of day.

Prior behavior is a strong indicator of coupon acceptance across scenarios.
